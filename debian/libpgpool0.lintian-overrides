# There is already another libpcp in Debian, libpcp3/libpcp3-dev, therefore
# we call our packages libpgpool0/libpgpool-dev. We have a file conflict
# with /usr/lib/libpcp.{a,so}, so libpgpool-dev conflicts with libpcp3-dev.
# As they are already at SONAME 3 while we are at 0, the other package will
# not problems with our files in /usr/lib. (The alternative solution of
# putting libpcp.so.* in /usr/lib/pgpool2 would require setting RPATH in
# several places, which was both unsupported by the current build system
# (despite the documentation claiming otherwise) and also pretty ugly.)
